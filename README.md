###  How to Integrate with Different Frameworks

TypeScript Environment

```typescript

import TitanStorage from './dist/esm/TitanStorage.js';	

```

JavaScript Environment
In a JavaScript environment, you should import TitanStorage.js from the dist/umd directory like this:

```javascript

import TitanStorage from './dist/umd/TitanStorage.js';

const result = TitanStorage.initialize({
            token: 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE3Mjg1NDk3MDUsImlkIjoidGl0YW4xamg0bnRmd3lsOXhxazllaGcycTdzNDR3OTlhZjkzOWpjZ3JkMmQiLCJvcmlnX2lhdCI6MTcyODQ2MzMwNSwicm9sZSI6MH0.qBw3BBHSC3piHmiwGawOMD14xkBZ9SnueeqAUfL5uX4',
